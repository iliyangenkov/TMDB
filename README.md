# TMDB Movie Data Exploration and Visualisation

## Project Overview
An independent challenge project aiming to analyse and visualise trends in a comprehensive movie database. By drawing insights insights and identifying trends, our client 'The Movie Database' hopes to use this information to create a movie recommendation system for its customers. The goal was to create a story that I will tell to my technical manager about my findings. This was towards the start of my journey towards data exploration with python.

## Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   The raw dataset undergoes a rigorous cleaning process to handle:
   - Inconsistencies between source and destination date formats       
   - Extracting data from dictionaries to make it more compatible for analysis and visualisation
   - Missing values 

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Gaining insights from the dataset through:
   - Exploring the distributions of Genres and other variables in the data  
   - Conducting individual film analysis on two films of choice, involving research outside the dataset

3. **Data Visualisation**  
   Using seaborn and matplotlib to illustrate trends:
   - Visualise key patterns and trends to show relationships between features
   - Organise my notebook and visualisations to tell a story to my technical manager
   - Summarise key findings that would of use to the client
