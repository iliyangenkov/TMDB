# TMDB
Challenge Project looking at EDA and Visualisation of a Movie Dataset

## Deliverables
1. **3 Python visualisations** showcasing insights drawn from the data
2. **2 keypoints** drawn from the data - explicitly stated in Markdown format and explained by your code & findings. What did you find most interesting? Or most surprising? Why is that?
3. Select **2 movies** on which to provide a more **in-depth single observation analysis**. Why have you selected these two? What's interesting about them? How do they compare to similar movies?

## Tools
**Python**
  - **Pandas** for general dataframe operations
  - **Matplotlib** for customising visualisations
  - **Seaborn** for creating visualisations
  - **Numpy** for mathematical operations
